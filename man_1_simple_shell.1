.TH HSH 1 "April 2025" "1.0" "Simple UNIX Shell Manual"

.SH NAME
hsh \- A simple UNIX command-line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a custom UNIX shell built in C, inspired by classic shells like
.BR sh (1)
and
.BR bash (1).
It reads user commands, parses them, executes built-in or external programs, and interacts with the system environment.

This shell also features a unique design touch: each session can output a random quote from a static list, inspired by the Puerto Rican pop culture figure, Jovani VÃ¡zquez.

.SH FEATURES
.TP
Prints a command prompt and waits for input
.TP
Tokenizes input into commands and arguments
.TP
Handles built-in commands like
.BR cd ,
.BR exit ,
and
.BR pwd
.TP
Manages environment variables via
.BR getenv ,
.BR setenv ,
and
.BR unsetenv
.TP
Locates executables using the
.B PATH
environment variable
.TP
Creates child processes using
.BR fork ()
and replaces them using
.BR execve ()
.TP
Waits for child processes using
.BR wait ()
or
.BR waitpid ()
.TP
Gracefully handles
.B EOF
(Ctrl+D)

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B cd [dir]
Changes the current working directory
.TP
.B pwd
Displays the current directory
.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell

.SH QUOTE MECHANISM
Each time the shell runs, it selects and prints a quote from a static list:
.IP \[bu]
Quotes are stored in a read-only array
.IP \[bu]
A persistent counter tracks calls to the function
.IP \[bu]
The quote index is chosen using
.B (getpid() + counter) % n
.IP \[bu]
This ensures variety across calls and processes

.SH SYSTEM CONCEPTS

.SS Process IDs
- PID: Unique identifier of a running process
- PPID: Parent process's PID

.SS Environment Access
- Use
.B getenv()
to read
- Use
.B setenv()
or
.B unsetenv()
to modify

.SS Functions vs System Calls
- Functions run in user space
- System calls interact with the OS kernel directly

.SS Prototypes of main
.nf
int main(void);
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
int main(int argc, char **argv);
.fi

.SS Executing Programs
.nf
execve("/bin/ls", args, environ);
.fi

.SS Waiting for Children
.nf
int status;
wait(&status);
.fi

.SS End-of-File
Triggered by Ctrl+D or when input reaches end.
