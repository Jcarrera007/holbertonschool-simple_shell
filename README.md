# Simple Shell Project

This project is a simple UNIX command-line interpreter, also known as a shell. It mimics basic functionalities of traditional UNIX shells like `sh` or `bash`, including executing commands, managing processes, and interacting with the environment.

## üìö Concepts

- **Our concept name is based on the first letters of each of our names and based on a local popular figure Jovani Vazquez (a Puerto Rican Folklore)**

- **Concept uniqueness and personality is as follows**
  A list of quotes is stored in a static array.
  We calculate the number of quotes using sizeof.
  A static counter keeps track of how many times the function runs.
  The quote is selected using the process ID plus the counter, wrapped within the array size.
  This ensures a different quote is shown on each call.
  Finally, the selected quote is printed with a bit of spacing for style.

### üß† History & Key Figures

- **Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system?**  
  Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

- **Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell?**  
  Stephen R. Bourne wrote the first widely used UNIX shell, known as the Bourne shell (`sh`).

- **Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)?**  
  Ken Thompson developed the B language, which led to the development of C by Dennis Ritchie.

- **Who is Ken Thompson?**  
  A computer scientist known for co-creating the UNIX operating system, the B programming language, and early contributions to computer science and security.

### üñ•Ô∏è How Does a Shell Work?

A shell reads user input, parses it into commands and arguments, locates the executable using the `PATH` environment variable, and uses system calls like `fork()` and `execve()` to create a new process and execute the command.

---

### üî¢ PID and PPID

- **PID (Process ID)**: A unique number assigned to a running process by the operating system.
- **PPID (Parent Process ID)**: The process ID of the process that created (or forked) the current process.

You can retrieve these values using system calls:
```c
pid_t pid = getpid();   // Gets current process ID
pid_t ppid = getppid(); // Gets parent process ID
```

### üåç Manipulating the Environment

You can access and modify the environment using:
- `getenv()` ‚Äì Retrieve environment variable
- `setenv()` ‚Äì Set or update an environment variable
- `unsetenv()` ‚Äì Remove an environment variable

These allow a shell to read `PATH`, `HOME`, etc., and adjust behavior accordingly.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Function vs System Call

- **Function**: A reusable block of code in user space, often part of a library.
- **System Call**: A function that requests a service from the operating system kernel (e.g., `execve`, `fork`, `read`, `write`).

### üìù Prototypes of `main`

C programs may define `main` using any of the following prototypes:
```c
int main(void);
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
int main(int argc, char **argv);
```

---

### üîç Using PATH

The shell searches each directory in the `PATH` environment variable for the command. If found, it uses `execve()` to run it.

---

### üöÄ Executing Programs with `execve`

`execve` replaces the current process image with a new process image.

```c
execve("/bin/ls", args, environ);
```

---

### ‚è≥ Waiting for Children

To wait until a child process finishes, use `wait()` or `waitpid()`:

```c
int status;
pid_t child_pid = wait(&status);
```

---

### ‚õî EOF (End-of-File)

EOF signifies no more input. It's often triggered by:
- `Ctrl+D` on UNIX/Linux
- `feof(stdin)` or checking for `read()` returning `0`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features of This Shell

- Prints a prompt
- Tokenizes input
- Handles built-in and external commands
- Manages environment variables
- Uses `fork()` and `execve()` to execute processes
- Handles process termination with `wait()`
- Interprets EOF and handles exit gracefully
